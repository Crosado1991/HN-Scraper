#Notes
URL structure: This scraper only works on the Hacker News homepage (https://news.ycombinator.com/news). Expanding the scope will require additional code for pagination or other page structures.
Error handling: If certain elements are missing (e.g., articles with no upvotes), the script will handle these cases gracefully by assigning zero upvotes.
